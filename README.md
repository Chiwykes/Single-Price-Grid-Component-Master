## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox




### What I learned

Understanding the use of flex box and hover state when designing the web page.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.container {
  width:350px;
  height: fit-content;
  margin-top: 100px;
}
```




### Continued development
I will continue to work and improve with projects allowing me to make use of flex box, grid and others.
